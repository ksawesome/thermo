# CAD Notes for p(T,v) Surface

Since Fusion 360 is not available in this environment, the CAD agent would:

1. Import STL from stl/pTv_surface.stl
2. Add base plate with axes labels:
   - T axis: 0-140 mm (220-360 K)
   - v axis: 0-70 mm (log scale)
   - Height: 0-70 mm (p scale)
3. Engrave labels: "R134a p(T,v)", units, saturation dome
4. Create section planes for removable cuts
5. Export STLs: full, sections, base

For virtual model, the STL is ready for viewing in any STL viewer.
